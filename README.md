🗳️ VotingSystem Smart Contract
A simple and gas-efficient decentralized voting system built using Solidity.
It allows users to create proposals and vote on them using their Ethereum wallet address. Each user can vote only once, ensuring fair and transparent governance.

📌 Features
✅ Create proposals with a description.

🗳️ Vote on any existing proposal.

🔒 One vote per wallet (prevents duplicate voting).

📊 Public visibility of all proposals and vote counts.

🛠️ Deployment
This contract can be compiled and deployed using:

Remix IDE

Hardhat

Truffle

Example in Remix:
Paste the code into Remix.

Compile with Solidity version ^0.8.20.

Deploy to a local or testnet environment.

Interact with createProposal, vote, and getProposals.

🚨 Limitations
Each address can vote only once across all proposals.

No time limits or proposal expiration.

No role-based permissions (e.g., anyone can create a proposal).

🚀 Future Improvements (Optional)
Allow 1 vote per proposal instead of globally.

Add admin-only access to proposal creation.

Implement voting deadlines and quorum requirements.

Token-weighted voting (ERC-20 governance).

Event logging for votes and creations.
